# Checkpoint 1 - JS

Your 1st checkpoint !

**!!! FIRST MANDATORY STEP BEFORE STARTING THE FIRST EXERCISE!!!**

- Clone this project
- Create a branch "first-name_last-name" and checkout it, as it will contain your progress. (of course, first-name and last-name should be replaced by your first and last name...)

**Each time you complete an exercise:**

- Make sure you are in the correct branch (first-name_last-name)
- Stage and commit your changes with an EXPLICIT message on your branch. Comments example: `"quiz completed"` or `"algo1 completed"`
- Push your branch first-name_last-name

## Part 1: Portfolio

### Warning : You have to do it without without Bootstrap (or any other CSS framework), you will have to use flexbox instead!

Follow the instructions in the file > [home.html](./site/home.html) (for better reading open it in your browser)

## Part 2: JS Algorithms

Do all the algos.
Unit tests are present, they will allow you to know if your algos work!

To launch them you must first install the dependencies (with `npm install` :wink:)".
Then you can run them :

```sh
npm test # this command runs all the tests
npm run test:1 # this command runs the tests for algo 1 only
npm run test:2 # this command runs the tests for algo 2 only
# etc... for all algos.
```

> [algo1.js](./algo/1/thirdAngle.js)
>
> [algo2.js](./algo/2/isLeapYear.js)
>
> [algo3.js](./algo/3/theaterSeats.js)

BONUS (optional)

> [algo4.js](./algo/4/findAdults.js)
>
> [algo5.js](./algo/5/getPoints.js)
>
> [algo6.js](./algo/6/sumArr.js)
